    "# Overview\n",
    "An iterable represents a collection of items that is capable of being iterated over. Iteration occurs by assigning one element at a time from the collection to a local variable using python's built-in \"for x in y\" language construct. The actual execution of such an iteration is carried out by using an object called an iterator, which encapsulates the logic of a one-time loop over the iterable's elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists, dicts, and numpy arrays are all iterables, because you can say `for x in my_list:` or `for x in my_dict:`, or `for x in my_array:`, and python will establish a loop that automatically binds x to the successive elements of these collections. Such functionality is not limited to built-in types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any class in python can become an iterable simply by defining an `__iter__()` method for the class. The `__iter__()` method is called implicitly by the python interpreter when the interpreter sees a for-loop, and it expects the method to return an object called an iterator, which is responsible for doing the actual work of returning the elements of the container. The iterator does its job by defining a `__next__()` method, which returns successive elements from the collection each time it is called, raising a `StopIteration` exception when there are no more elements to return.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple example of an iterable and an illustration of its usage. Take a look at the code, and then we'll discuss how it works."

    "# Execution Details\n",
    "Let's go through the details of how the for-loop above works. When the python interpreter sees the expression `for element in container:`, it automatically expects that container is an iterable. The object `container` is an instance of class `SimpleIterable`, and it is indeed an iterable, by virtue of defining an `__iter__()` method. *Any* class that defines an `__iter__()` method causes its instances to be iterables. This is an example of \"duck typing\". The type is determined not by inheriting from a particular class, but just by virtue of  implementing a specified interface. In this case, the interface consists of a single method: the `__iter__()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python interpreter duly calls the iterable's `__iter__()` method and duly receives back an instance of `SimpleIterator`. Just as container is an iterable by virtue of defining an `__iter__()` method, the `SimpleIterator` instance this method returns is an iterator by virtue of defining a `__next__()` method, again by duck typing. The purpose of the `__next__()` method is to return successive elements of the original container each time `__next__()` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python interpreter implements the for-loop by repeatedly calling the iterator's `__next__()` method and binding its returned values to the variable `element`. It expects the iterator to raise a `StopIteration` exception when it  has returned the last element of the container. Python arranges to automatically trap this exception and exits from  the loop when it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Summary\n",
    "In sum, an iterable is a container that knows how to loop through its elements by returning an iterator to do the job. Python establishes the interfaces that iterables and iterators must respect. Any object that defines an __iter__() method is an iterable. Any object that defines a __next__() method and raises a StopIteration exception is an iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are lots of ways the above protocols can go wrong. Here are some of them. If you write the expression `for x in my_obj:`, but `my_obj` does not define an `__iter__()` method, then this will crash with an error message saying that `__iter__()` is undefined for `my_obj`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the `__iter__()` method exists, but the object it returns does not have a `__next__()` method, then this will crash with an error message saying that `__next__()` is not defined for the returned object. If the returned object never raises a `StopIteration` exception, then the for-loop will never terminate, unless it contains an explicit return or break within its body. There are times when this is exactly the desired behavior, i.e., when the iterable being looped over is intended to represent an infinite collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Builtin Functions Related to Iterators and Generators\n",
    "There are some built-in functions in python you should know about that relate to iterables and iterators, allowing you to deal with them explicitly outside of the context of a for-loop. Even though 90% of the time you'll just invoke them implicitly via a for-loop, there are definitely times when it is desirable to have more control over the iteration, and this is the primary advantage one gains by using iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The iter() function\n",
    "The `iter()` function calls the `__iter__()` method of an iterable and returns an iterator over the iterable. For example, `iter(my_list)` returns an iterator over the elements of `my_list`. Similarly `iter(my_dict)` returns an iterator over the keys in `my_dict`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The next() function\n",
    "In like manner, the `next()` function invokes the `__next__()` method of an iterator. So, if `my_iterator` is an iterator, the pythonic way to call its `__next()__` method explicitly is via `next(my_iterator)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The list() function\n",
    "Also, if `my_iterator` is an iterator, you can turn it into a list by calling `list()` on it. \n",

    "# The Difference Between Iterables And Iterators\n",
    "It might seem as though iterables and iterators are too close together in purpose to require they be distinct kinds of objects. They seem like they're almost the same thing. Wouldn't it have been better if they actually *were* the same thing? \n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, you can make them so that they *are* the same thing--which I will mention in a moment--but there is actually an important conceptual distinction between them that can be maintained *if you keep them distinct objects*: after an iterator has returned its last element, it is empty and forever empty (under normal use cases). Successive calls to its `__next__()` method always raise a `StopIteration` exception. By contrast, the iterable from which it was derived still has all its elements, if you have kept it distinct from the iterable. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the iterable and iterator are kept as separate objects, then the iterable represents something that is *capable of being iterated over*, while the iterator represents a single iteration through its elements. For example, consider the list `x = [1,3,5,7]` in the example above. Every time you do `for e in x:...` python creates a *new* iterator to iterate over the list's elements, yet the iterable itself remains unchanged. You can see this distinction when, above,\n",
    "the contents of `my_iterator` are printed out (after being assigned to the list `y`). At the time `y` is printed out,\n",
    "the iterator has already yielded two elements, so `y` only contains the remaining elements `[5,7]`. By contrast,\n",
    "`x` still consists of the unaltered original list `[1,3,5,7]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, you needn't make iterables separate objects from iterators. You can merge the concepts of iterable and iterator simply by defining a class whose `__iter__()` method returns self AND which also defines a `__next__()` method. Following the rule of duck typing, since such a class defines both `__iter__()` and `__next__()`, it is both an iterable and an iterator. By returning `self` in response to `__iter__()`, the iterable is telling the python interpreter to use this same object as its own iterator. Notice, though, when you do this, that the iterable loses its elements as it is iterated through and eventually becomes empty. This organization creates \"one-shot\" iterables whose behavior is essentially just that of an iterator. There is nothing wrong with this organization; however, as you will see in a section or two, you normally don't have to worry about the distinction between these two architectures, because generators offer a superior method of creating iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages of Iterables\n",
    "One of the important advantages of creating a custom iterable in preference to merely using a list is *lazy calculation*. In order to instantiate a list, the list must calculate all its elements first and store them all in memory. If the list is a long one, this can be intensive in both time and space. By contrast, an iterator only ever need allocate enough memory to calculate the` __next__()` element in the iteration, and it only ever need expend enough computational effort to calculate that next element. It doesn't waste time calculating all the elementsbat once. In the `SimpleIterable` example above, suppose we had set `num_elements` to a large number such as one billion. This doesn't allocate any more memory than if we set `num_elements` to a small number such as 5, because the collection is represented abstractly and the iterator only ever calculates the next element from the previous element. By contrast, representing a list of one billion elements would take a few gigabytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going further: what if the collection we want to represent is infinite? Then it would be impossible to create a list containing all its elements. Yet there are use cases for infinite collections. For example, the number of primes is infinite.  If you want to loop through all the primes while searching for the first one that satisfies some property, the most elegant way to do this is just to create an iterable that represents all primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of iterables is filtering. The set of primes can be thought of as what you get when you filter the set of positive integers for just those that are prime. By wrapping up the filtering logic in an iterable, client code can ignore all the logic that goes into doing the filtering and concentrate instead on just the elements (primes) that pass the filter. This makes client code simpler. You can see this clarity illustrated in the examples below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to filtering is _data re-organization_. If one has an iterable whose elements are not ideally organized for the task at hand, a second iterable can be interposed that restructures them so that the task at hand can be expressed more clearly, again allowing client code to hide the cumbersome details that don't really relate to the meat of the problem. For example, if one's application is interested in pairs of consecutive primes, an iterable can be created that returns pairs of consecutive primes. This is also illustrated in the examples below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples below illustrate all of the above advantages of iterables. Our first goal is to find the first prime greater than 100 whose remainder when divided by 7 is 1.\n",

    "# Final Thoughts On Iterables\n",
    "Here is a final thought about iterables. One way to think of them is that they formalize the concept of iteration by creating an object that represents the iteration--one that can be manipulated programmatically--and there is power inherent in this ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, when you create a normal loop in python, the code that represents the loop is *not* an object that can be manipulated. It can't be passed around to other methods, and you can't programmatically ask it to run its body just once. But you *can* do this with an iterable. Calling the `__next__()` method of an iterator is equivalent to asking it to run the body of a loop just once. You can pass this loop body around to other methods, each of which might ask it to run the loop body one or more times. This is very powerful control. Whenever you have a normal loop, you could consider turning it into an iterable instead. Most of the time, you won't need to do this, but sometimes you will find that doing so gives you extra flexibility that you can take advantage of. Here's a typical example: suppose you have a main loop that embodies the functioning of some complex system whose inner workings you would like to \"instrument\", which means you want to print out some status information about the system each time through its main loop. Rather than embedding your instrumentation code throughout the system code, you can embody the system code in an iterable and put the instrumentation code in *client* code that calls next() on the iterable, followed by the instrumentation code. This allows you to completely separate the system-level code from the instrumentation code. Here's an outline of an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    class MySystem(object):\n",
    "      def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.foo = 0 # member variable of interest whose value changes each time through the main loop.\n",
    "        self.bar = 0 # member variable of interest whose value changes each time through the main loop.\n",
    "        self.baz = 0 # member variable of interest whose value changes each time through the main loop.\n",
    "\n",

    "        return self\n",

    "      def __next__(self):\n",
    "        if self.time_to_stop():\n",
    "          raise StopIteration()\n",
    "\n",
    "        <implement the body of our main loop>\n",

    "        return self\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Here we instrument the system by printing out relevant member variables.\n",
    "    # The instrumentation is contained in client code that is wholly isolated from the implementation\n",
    "    # of the system itself.\n",
    "    def my_instrumented_client_code():\n",
    "      for sys in MySystem():\n",

    "# Generators\n",
    "Despite the elegance and flexibility achieved by using iterables, we must admit that, up to now, they have seemed rather cumbersome to implement. Up till now, for each iterable we have needed to define an iterable class, and usually, a separate iterator class as well. As it turns out, we don't actually need to do all this. There's a cleaner, more concise way to implement iterators using something called a *generator*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that any iterator class we created above needed to have a member variable that cached some state to remember where it had left off at the end of the previous `__next__()` call. Generators take this idea one step further: they *automically* cache *all* the state of a computation, and they do this for you implicitly, so that you don't have to worry about it. The language construct that allows this to happen is the`\"yield` expression. When `yield` is encountered in a function or method, all the internal state of the computation is *saved* so that the computation can be continued at a later time *exactly where it left off*. _A generator is an object that\n",

    "When `generate_primes_in_range()` is called above on line 17, the python interpreter notices that the function contains a `yield` expression within its function body on line 10. The presence of the `yield` expression tells the interpreter to treat the function as a generator. The interpreter therefore handles the function call specially. It evaluates the arguments to the function and assigns their values to the function's parameters, but it then suspends execution of the function and immediately returns without executing any of the code that is in its body. The object that it returns is called a generator object, and this is assigned to be the value of the variable `primes_generator`. This generator object represents the state of execution of the function.\n",
    "It is both an iterable and an iterator. It returns itself in response to the `__iter__()` message, and in response to the `__next__()` message, it runs its code just up to next occurrence of the `yield` expression. When it encounters a yield expression, the argument(s) to yield are returned as the value(s) of the `__next__()` message.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to emphasize that \"functions\" containing `yield` always return immediately, and the object they return is called a _generator_. This object represents a frozen state of computation. The way to tell the generator to resume execution is to send it a `__next__()` message. This causes the generator to resume execution just until it hits the next `yield` statement. The arguments to `yield` become the value(s) returned by `__next()__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this plays out in line 20 above. They python interpreter notices the for-loop and therefore treats `primes_generator` as an iterable. It asks the iterable to give up an iterator for itself by calling `__iter__()` on it, and, as mentioned above, the iterable just returns itself as the iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Treating the generator as an iterator now, python then asks the generator to return its next element by sending it a `__next__()` message. This resumes execution of the `generate_primes_in_range()` function from the point where it last left off, which was just assigning values to its parameters. The initial value of `x` is 4, but 4 is not prime, so the `yield` expression on line 10 is not evaluated. The next time through the loop, the value of `x` is 5. This *is* prime, so the `yield` expression is reached. This causes suspension of the execution of the function and the number 5 is returned as the value of the `__next__()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python interpreter, in executing the for-loop, continues sending `__next__()` messages to the generator. Every time the generator is sent a `__next__()` message, it resumes execution where it last left off, and keeps executing until one of two things happens: either it evaluates a `yield` expression, in which case the argument(s) to yield are returned as the value(s) of `__next__()`, or it evaluates a return expression (which includes \"falling off\" the end of the function), in which case, instead of returning from `__next__()`, it raises a `StopIteration` exception. In the example above, there is no explicit return statement in the function\n",
    "body. However, when `x` hits the value of `finish` (which is set to 15), the while loop exits and the function \"falls off\" the end of its code body, which implicitly results in a return and raises a `StopIteration` exception that causes the interpreter to terminate the for-loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Generators With Iterable Classes\n",
    "The example above didn't use any classes. It just used the function `generate_primes_in_range()` to return a generator. Often, this is all we need. But there are limitations to not having a class. For example, the resulting generator object is good only as an iterator. We can't ask it what its `start` or `finish` are. But, if we use an instance of a class that stores these values as member variables then we can always interrogate it about its start and finish. The example below shows how this is done."
