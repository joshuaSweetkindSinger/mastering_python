    "# Overview\n",
    "An iterable represents a container (a collection of items) that is capable of being iterated over. Iteration occurs by assigning one element at a time from the container to a local variable using python's built-in `for x in y:` language construct. The actual execution of such an iteration is carried out by using an object called an iterator, which encapsulates the process of a one-time loop over the container's elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lists, dicts, and numpy arrays are all iterables, because you can say `for x in my_list:`, or `for x in my_dict:`, or `for x in my_array:`, and python will establish a loop that automatically binds x to the successive elements of these containers. Such functionality is not limited to built-in types. Python allows one to extend the `for x in y:` language construct so that it works for any arbitrary object `y` you care to define. One does this by making `y` an iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make an instance an iterable, its class must define an `__iter__()` method. Whenever the python interpreter sees a for-loop of the form `for x in y:`, it implements the loop by sending `y` an `__iter__()` message, and it expects the method to return an object called an iterator, which is responsible for doing the actual work of returning the elements of the container `y`. These get bound one at a time to the local variable `x`. \n",
    "\n",
    "An iterator does its job by defining a `__next__()` method, which returns successive elements from the container it represents each time `__next__()` is called, raising a `StopIteration` exception when there are no more elements to return. In addition to defining the `__next()__` method, an iterator must _also_ define the `__iter__()` method, returning itself as the value. These two methods constitute the [iterator protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#iterator-types). Note that, once an iterator raises `StopIteration` in response to the `__next__()` message, signalling that there are no more elements left, it must always and forever raise `StopIteration` on future calls to `__next__()`. An iterator that does not do so is considered a broken implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a simple example of an iterable and an illustration of its usage. Take a look at the code, and then we'll discuss how it works."

    "# Execution Details\n",
    "Let's go through the details of how the for-loop above works. When the python interpreter sees the expression `for element in container:`, it expects container to be an iterable. The object `container` is an instance of class `SimpleIterable`, and it is indeed an iterable, by virtue of defining an `__iter__()` method. *Any* class that defines an `__iter__()` method causes its instances to be iterables. This is an example of \"duck typing\". The type is determined not by inheriting from a particular class, but just by virtue of  implementing a specified interface. In this case, the interface consists of a single method: the `__iter__()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the for-loop, the python interpreter begins by calling the iterable's `__iter__()` method and expects to receive back an iterator. In this case, it receives an instance of `SimpleIterator`. Just as container is an iterable by virtue of defining an `__iter__()` method, the `SimpleIterator` instance this method returns is an iterator by virtue of defining both an `__iter__()` method and a `__next__()` method, again by duck typing. The purpose of the `__next__()` method is to return successive elements of the original container each time `__next__()` is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python interpreter then implements the for-loop by repeatedly calling the iterator's `__next__()` method and binding its returned values to the variable `element`. It expects the iterator to raise a `StopIteration` exception when there are no elements left to return, which occurrs just after it has returned the element 0. Python arranges to automatically trap this exception and exits from the loop when it occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Summary\n",
    "An iterable is a container that knows how to loop through its elements by returning an iterator to do the job. Python establishes the interfaces that iterables and iterators must respect. Any object is an iterable if it defines an `__iter__()` method. Any object is an iterator if it defines both an `__iter__()` method that returns `self` and a `__next__()` method that returns successive elements from its associated container, raising a StopIteration exception after returning its last element.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Built-in Functions Related to Iterators and Generators\n",
    "There are some built-in functions in python you should know about that relate to iterables and iterators, allowing you to deal with them explicitly outside of the context of a for-loop. Even though 90% of the time you'll just invoke them implicitly via a for-loop, there are definitely times when it is desirable to have more control over the iteration, and this is the primary advantage one gains by using iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The iter() function\n",
    "The `iter()` function is the pythonic way to call the `__iter__()` method of an iterable. As such, it returns an iterator over the iterable. For example, `iter(my_list)` returns an iterator over the elements of `my_list`. Similarly `iter(my_dict)` returns an iterator over the keys in `my_dict`. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The next() function\n",
    "In like manner, the `next()` function is the pythonic way to call the `__next__()` method of an iterator. So, if `my_iterator` is an iterator, then `next(my_iterator)` returns the next element from its associated container. \n",
    "\n",
    "## The list() function\n",
    "If `my_iterator` is an iterator, you can turn it into a list by calling `list()` on it. Note that this exhausts\n",
    "the iterator, i.e.,  `my_iterator` will be empty after `list()` has been called on it. That is because `list()` does its job by calling `__next__()` on `my_iterator` to get all its elements.\n",

    "# The Difference Between Iterables And Iterators\n",
    "It might seem as though iterables and iterators are too close together in purpose to require they be distinct kinds of objects. In fact, there is an important distinction. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting to the distinction, let's first note that all iterators _are_ iterables, by duck-typing. An iterator is a special kind of iterable, which we might call a _one shot_ iterable. Inasmuch as it represents a container of elements, the elements an iterator represents keep changing. Each time `__next__()` is called, the iterator has one less element than it had before. Once the iterator is empty, it remains forever empty, hence the appellation _one shot_.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, an iterable need not be a one shot container. To the contrary, it is usually desirable for the set of elements an iterable represents _not_ to change. You can see this distinction in the previous code example above. On lines 32 and 33, the iterable x remains unchanged. Its contents never get depleted. By contrast, on lines 20 and 21, the iterator y is depleted, becoming empty after line 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using both an iterable class and a separate iterator class, we can allow the iterable to represent an unchanging container that is *capable of being iterated over*, while the iterator represents a single iteration through the iterable's elements. If this distinction is not required for our use case, then we can get away with just defining an iterator class and calling it a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The Difference Between Iterables And Containers\n",
    "In practice there is very little difference between a container and an iterable. Certainly all iterables are containers. Conversely, it is hard to imagine a useful data-structure representing a container that does not also supply the ability to iterate through its contents. One counter-example might be an object representing all real numbers between `a` and `b`. Such an object can easily say whether or not it contains a given floating point number `x`, but iterating through all the floating point numbers between `a` and `b`, while possible, is unlikely to be useful. Whether such an object deserves to be called a _container_ is also a question of semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't discuss the subject further. In practice, when we call an object an _iterable_, we wish to emphasize the fact that it can be iterated over, and when we call the same object a _container_, we wish to emphasize the fact that it is a collection of elements, probably providing several means of element-access beyond mere iteration, such as via position, in the case of a list, or via keyword in the case of a dict.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Advantages of Custom Iterables\n",
    "One of the important advantages of creating a custom iterable, in preference to merely using a list, is *lazy calculation*. In order to instantiate a list, the list must calculate all its elements first and store them all in memory. If the list is a long one, this can be intensive in both time and space. By contrast, an iterator only ever need allocate enough memory to calculate the next element in the iteration, and it only ever need expend enough computational effort to calculate that next element. It doesn't waste time calculating all the elements at once. In the `SimpleIterable` example above, suppose we had set `num_elements` to a large number such as one billion. This doesn't allocate any more memory than if we set `num_elements` to a small number such as 5, because the collection is represented abstractly and the iterator only ever calculates the next element from the previous element. By contrast, representing a list of one billion elements would take a few gigabytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Going further, what if the collection we want to represent is infinite? Then it would be impossible to create a list containing all its elements. Yet there are use cases for infinite collections. For example, the number of primes is infinite.  If we want to loop through all the primes while searching for the first one that satisfies some property, the most elegant way to do this is just to create an iterable that represents all primes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage of iterables is that they give us a way to encapsulate filtering logic, making it separate from the client code that uses that logic. For example, the set of primes can be thought of as what one gets when one filters the set of positive integers for just those that are prime. Using an iterable gives us a way to wrap up the filtering logic, making it distinct from the client code that uses it. Client code can then ignore all the logic that goes into doing the filtering and concentrate instead on just its particular use case for primes. This makes client code simpler. Further, by separating out the filtering process from the client's use case, the iterable becomes re-usable by other clients that want to do something different with the container of primes. You can see this clarity illustrated in the examples below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Related to filtering is _data re-organization_. If one has an iterable whose elements are not ideally structured for the task at hand, a second iterable can be interposed that restructures them so that the task at hand can be expressed more clearly, again allowing client code to hide cumbersome details that don't really relate to the meat of the problem. For example, if one's application is interested in pairs of consecutive primes, a second iterable can be created on top of the first primes iterable that restructures the data to return pairs of consecutive primes. This is also illustrated in the examples below.\n",

    "# Final Thoughts About Iterables And Iterators\n",
    "Here is a final thought about iterables and iterators. One way to think of them is that they formalize the concept of iteration by creating an object that represents the iteration--one that can be manipulated programmatically--and there is power inherent in this ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, when you create a normal loop in python, the code that represents the loop is *not* an object that can be manipulated. It can't be passed around to other methods, and you can't programmatically ask it to run its body just once. But you *can* do this with an iterable. Calling the `__next__()` method of an iterator is equivalent to asking it to run the body of a loop just once. You can pass this loop body around to other methods, each of which might ask it to run the loop body one or more times. This is very powerful control. Whenever you have a normal loop, you could consider turning it into an iterable instead. Most of the time, you won't need to do this, but sometimes you will find that doing so gives you extra flexibility that you can take advantage of. Here's a typical example: suppose you have a main loop that embodies the functioning of some complex system whose inner workings you would like to \"instrument\", which means you want to print out some status information about the system each time through its main loop. Rather than embedding your instrumentation code throughout the system code, you can embody the system code in an iterable and put the instrumentation code in *client* code that calls next() on the iterable, followed by the instrumentation code. This allows you to completely separate the system-level code from the instrumentation code. Here's an outline of what this would look like:\n",

    "    class MySystem(object):\n",
    "      def __init__(self):\n",
    "        self.foo = 0 # member variable of interest whose value changes each time through the main loop.\n",
    "        self.bar = 0 # member variable of interest whose value changes each time through the main loop.\n",
    "        self.baz = 0 # member variable of interest whose value changes each time through the main loop.\n",

    "# Generators\n",
    "Despite the elegance and flexibility achieved by using iterables, we must admit that, up till now, they have seemed rather cumbersome to implement. Up till now, we've needed to define at least one class, possibly two, and we've needed to define two methods: `__iter__()`, and `__next__()`, with the latter method usually being a little bit complicated, due to the need to preserve state between calls. Generator iterators unburden us from having to preserve state: they *automatically* cache *all* the state of a computation, and they do this for us implicitly, so that we don't have to worry about it. The language construct that allows this to happen is the `yield` statement. When `yield` is encountered in a function or method, all the internal state of the computation is *saved* so that the computation can be continued at a later time *exactly where it left off*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Put another way, _a generator iterator is an object that represents a frozen state of computation_. Generator iterators are implemented as iterators (as their name implies), which is to say that a generator iterator object answers to both the `__iter__()` and `__next_()` messages. In response to `__iter__()`, a generator iterator simply returns itself (as required by the iterator protocol). In response to `__next()__`, a generator iterator resumes execution from where it last left off until one of two things happens: either it encounters a `yield` statement, in which case it returns the arguments to `yield` as the values of `__next__()` and saves its computation state, or it encounters a `return` expression or \"falls off\" the end of its function body, in which case it raises a `StopIteration` exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to emphasize that \"functions\" containing a `yield` statement always return immediately when they are \"called\", and the object they return is a _generator iterator_. This object represents a frozen state of computation. The way to tell the generator iterator to resume execution is to send it a `__next__()` message. This causes the generator iterator to continue execution just until it finishes execution of the next `yield` statement (or terminates by raising a StopIteration exception). The arguments to `yield` become the value(s) returned by `__next()__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We must pause to acknowledge that the term _generator iterator_ is a mouthful. Why not just call such an object a _generator_? If you re-read the previous paragraph above you'll notice we said that functions containing a `yield` statement return immediately, and the object they return is called a generator iterator. It is the function or method itself that is referred to as a _generator_. Thus, a generator is a function or method that, when called, returns a generator iterator. The distinction is usually clear from context, and, in practice, generator iterators are often referred to simply as generators. We will adopt this shorter, slightly ambiguous form for much of the rest of this notebook and will often refer to generator iterators simply as _generators_.\n",

    "When `generate_primes_in_range()` is called above on line 25, the python interpreter notices that the function contains a `yield` statement within its function body on line 15. The presence of the `yield` statement tells the interpreter to treat the function as a generator. The interpreter therefore handles the function call specially. It evaluates the arguments to the function and assigns their values to the function's parameters. It then suspends execution of the function and immediately returns without executing any of the code that is in its body. The object that it returns is called a _generator iterator_ object, and this is assigned to be the value of the variable `primes_generator`. This generator iterator object represents the state of execution of the function. As mentioned above, it is an iterator. It returns itself in response to the `__iter__()` message, and, in response to the `__next__()` message, it resumes execution from where it last left off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this plays out in line 31 above. The python interpreter notices the for-loop and therefore treats `primes_generator` as an iterable. It asks the iterable to supply an iterator for itself by calling `__iter__()` on it, and `primes_generator`, being an iterator, just returns itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python then asks this iterator to return its next element by sending it a `__next__()` message. This resumes execution of the `generate_primes_in_range()` function from the point where it last left off, which was just assigning values to its parameters. The initial value of `x` is 4, but 4 is not prime, so the `yield` statement on line 15 is not evaluated. The next time through the loop, the value of `x` is 5. This *is* prime, so the `yield` statement is reached. This causes suspension of the execution of the function and the number 5 is returned as the value of the `__next__()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The python interpreter, in executing the for-loop, continues sending `__next__()` messages to the generator iterator. Every time the generator iterator is sent a `__next__()` message, it resumes execution where it last left off, and keeps executing until one of two things happens: either it evaluates a `yield` statement, in which case the argument(s) to yield are returned as the value(s) of `__next__()`, or it evaluates a return expression (which includes \"falling off\" the end of the function), in which case, instead of returning from `__next__()`, it raises a `StopIteration` exception. In the example above, there is no explicit return statement in the function\n",

Some of the examples are re-done more than once, to illustrate that we can solve these problems with generators alone, but also by combining generators with classes that represent iterables.

As in the previous example, we could have also re-implemented it without any classes at all; however, having already illustrated that architecture above, we don't repeat it here. For all but the simplest cases, it probably makes more sense to define a class to represent the container in question."

    "The consecutive prime pairs examples above illustrate how iterables can be built on top of each other, with the output of one iterator feeding the input of the next. Such a data architecture is referred to as _chained_. Iterators make it very easy to chain data, for the purposes of data reorganization or filtering. In this final section, we emphasize the point by re-implementing each of the two examples involving primes in such a way as to add one more layer of chaining. \n",

    "The examples here are not particularly well-motivated. In practice, it is hard to imagine why creating iterables that represent primes equal to 1 mod 7, or creating iterables that represent consecutive prime pairs separated by 8, would be generically reusable. The point to be made is that the _technique_ illustrated is useful. If the set of primes equal to 1 mod 7 _were_ generally useful, then the way to codify that collection is with an iterable."
