We'll decide to make instances of class `Vector` immutable, which means that, once created, their (x,y) coordinates cannot be changed. This is a design choice. We didn't need to do it this way, but it makes sense for this class and it also will help illustrate some useful python concepts, such as the `@property` decorator.\n",

    "Note that our base class `Vector` inherits from the class `object`. Our base classes should always do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define an __init__ method if necessary\n",
    "The `__init__()` method is a special method. (In fact, all methods beginning and ending with two underscores, known as \"dunders\" in python (for \"double under\"), are special methods). It tells python how to initialize instances of class `Vector`. By creating an `__init__()` method with two args (`x` and `y`), we tell the python interpreter that we expect vectors to be created like so: `Vector(x, y)`, as is done on line 22 above. The `__init__()` method is called when the Vector object is created to initialize its member variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not always necessary to create an `__init__()` method. Every class always inherits an `__init__()` method from its parent. Sometimes, that method will work just fine, so there is no reason to create a new one. In the case of `Vector`, which inherits from `object`, a new method needs to be created, because the default `__init__()`  method on `object` takes 0 args, and we want to initialize our vectors with two args.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Make things private using underscores\n",
    "In python, by convention, whenever a variable, function, or method name begins with an underscore, it is private. That means that client code should not attempt to read it, write it, or call it, as the case may be. Only the code that \"owns\" it (typically the class it belongs to), should do these things. It is good form, when defining a class, to clearly demarcate its public interface. Those member variables and methods that are not named with leading underscores are deemed part of its public interface. Client code is free to both read and write the public member variables of an object, and it is free to call the public methods of an object. _Everything else is off limits._\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't want client code to be able to change the values of a vector's x and y components, but we do want client code to be able to read them. Naming our member variables `self._x` and `self._y` prevents client code from modifying them. In order to grant read-access to them, we created the public methods x() and y().\n",

    "# Make read-only properties with @property\n",
    "There is nothing wrong with our first draft of `Vector`, but it does seem a bit of a shame that we have to access a vector's x- and y-components via getter methods, e.g., `v.x()` and `v.y()`, rather than just accessing them like member variables, e.g., `v.x` and `v.y`. If `x` and `y` were public member variables, we'd be able to access them directly. It's only because they're private that we had to resort to getter methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, there is an elegant way to allow client code to use the expressions `v.x` and `v.y` to read the x- and y-components of a vector, as though they were member variables (even though they're not), while still disallowing writing. This is done with the `@property` decorator. The version below is identical to the version above, except that the two getter methods now have the `@property` decorator above their definitions. Take a look at the slightly modified version of the code below and then we'll discuss it in detail."

    "As we can see from the modified example section above, it is now possible to refer to the components of the vector `v` as `v.x` and `v.y` instead of the clunkier `v.x()` and `v.y()`. The methods we defined are still being called under the hood. Only the syntax has changed. This allows for a clearer class definition, because the x- and y-components feel like member variables, rather than methods. Conceptually, they truly should be member variables. We only interpose the methods to protect them from being written to. The `@property` decorator allows us to treat them as read-only member variables. (Of course, we can still write to `v._x` and `v._y` if we are willing to break  convention.)\n",

Doing so will allow us to \"call\" the method without employing open and close parentheses, e.g., via `my_obj.foo` instead of via `my_obj.foo()`. Things will look syntactically as though we're just reading a member variable. Don't try decorating with `@property` a method that takes more than `self` as arguments. It won't work, and, in fact, it would be meaningless, since we would have no way to pass the second arg to the method without using parentheses.\n",

Whenever any code invokes `rectangle.width = <blah>`, as on line 48 above, it is the setter method on line 24 that is called. The new value proposed for the `width` property--in this case 10--is passed in as an argument to the method. The method is solely responsible for handling the update. In our case, we not only have it update the member variable `_width` on line 26, but we also make sure the new proposed value is legal, raising an exception if it is not. If our setter had chosen not to update the `_width` member variable at all, then the width property would have remained unchanged!

When we decorate a method with `@property`, we are defining the getter method for a property of the same name as the method. By so doing, we automatically generate a new decorator to be the setter. If the name of the property is `foo`, then the name of the setter decorator becomes `@foo.setter`. We can use this decorator to define a setter method for the property `foo` if we wish.

So, for example, when, on line 37, we evaluate `blue_rectangle.declare_color()`, this invokes the `declare_color()` method on line 12, and, on line 16 we evaluate `self.COLOR`, where `self` points to an instance of `BlueRectangle`. Since the instance has no member variable called `COLOR` the interpreter looks to its parent, which is `BlueRectangle`, where it finds the class variable `COLOR` set to the value `BLUE`. If class `BlueRectangle` did not define the class variable `COLOR`, then the search would have continued to _its_ parent, `ColoredRectangle`, where it would have found the class variable `COLOR` set to the value `CLEAR`.\n",

    "# Abstract Classes and Methods\n",
    "An abstract class is a class that is never meant to be instantiated. Only some of its descendant classes are instantiated. For that reason, an abstract class is often referred to as an _abstract base class_.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several reasons why one might want to create an abstract base class. First, from a purely organizational point of view, an abstract base class can represent a meaningful concept. For example, consider a collection of classes representing two-dimensional objects that know how to draw themselves on a display. There might be instantiable classes named `Circle`, or `Rectangle`, or `Line`, and so on. The top-level base class to which they all belong might be named `Shape`, even though it makes no sense to instantiate a `Shape`. It would therefore be an abstract class. A child class of `Shape` might be called `Polygon`, to which `Rectangle` would belong as a descendant, but not `Circle` or `Line`. Since it makes no sense to instantiate a `Polygon` (without knowing more specific information), it too would be abstract.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, an abstract base class gives us a place to \"hang\" common code. If all the descendant classes of a parent class use exactly the same implementation of a particular method, then that method properly belongs on the parent class, even if the parent class is never, in itself, instantiated. For example, all the `Shape` subclasses might use the same `set_line_thickness()` method, in which case it could be defined by the `Shape` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, an abstract base class can _require_ that its descendants define certain methods, which remain undefined (stubs, really) in the base class. An abstract base class specifies such methods using the `@abstractmethod` decorator. A very typical use case is for an abstract base class to specify the entire public interface of all its descendants via the declaration of abstract methods. Another very typical use case is for an abstract base class to specify an abstract method because the base class plans to call that method itself in the implementation of one of its own methods. All of these use cases are demonstrated in the code example below.\n",

    "In python, a class is an abstract class if it inherits, directly, or indirectly from the class `ABC` _and_ at least one of its methods is also an abstract method."

    "## What super() does\n",
    "It is beyond the scope of this tutorial to go into the full functionality encompassed by `super()`. Here we will just discuss the main use case, which is fairly easy to understand. It is best described by example. Let's go through what happens when we create a `Particle` on line 124 above. The python interpreter creates an empty `Particle` object and then passes it to its `__init__()` method, along with the `position` and `velocity` arguments. The `Particle` class doesn't define its own `__init__()` method, so the new object uses the one it inherits from `Moveable` on line 66. The first thing that method does is call `super().__init__(position)` on line 69. The intent here should be clear. We want to call the `__init__()` method defined by the parent of `Moveable`, i.e., defined by `Positionable`, on line 51. And that is exactly what the python interpreter does.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How super() works . . . is complicated\n",
    "But notice that doing the \"obvious\" thing here is actually somewhat magical. The `self` arg being passed in on line 66 is actually an instance of `Particle`, not of `Moveable`, so one might think that its parent class should be `Moveable`, which would lead to an infinite recursion. Except that `self` isn't even passed to `super()`, so `super()` is not even given the opportunity to make that mistake. Somehow `super()` figures out the static context and knows that it is being invoked from inside class `Moveable`, so it knows that the right thing to do is to call the `__init__()` method on `Positionable`, ignoring the type of `self` altogether.\n",
    "\n",
    "But even that can't be exactly right, because, when the correct `__init__` method on line 51 is called, it needs to be passed an instance of `self`! And this instance has to be the one that was just created, i.e., the new `Particle` object, so that it can be initialized.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that what `super()` returns is a special object called a \"proxy\" object. The proxy object has the same methods as the desired parent--in this case, `Positionable`; however, when any of those methods is invoked, the proxy object arranges for the `self` argument passed to those methods to be the correct runtime object--in this case, the new `Particle` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "## In python 2.x, super() is different\n",
    "The `super()` built-in is less magical in python2.x, and more cumbersome to use. When using `super()` in python 2.x, one must specify explicitly the parent class of interest *and* the object to be used as `self`, like this: `super(Positionable, self).__init__(position)`. The preceding expression is what we would need to put on line 69 above.\n",
    "\n",
    "## With multiple inheritance, super() becomes more important.\n",
    "The workings of `super()` are even more complicated in a hierarchy with multiple inheritance. If a class has multiple parents, to which parent should `super()` refer? The way to do this properly is tricky and involves an understanding of python's [method resolution order](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.2.3/descrintro/#mro) (referred to often simply as _mro_). A lengthier discussion is beyond the scope of this tutorial."
