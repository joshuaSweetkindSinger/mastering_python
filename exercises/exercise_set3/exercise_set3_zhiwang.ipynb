    "#\n",
    "# Exercise 3.1.3\n",
    "# On your Recipe class:\n",
    "# Create a read-only \"name\" property that represents the name of the recipe.\n",
    "# Create a read-only \"ingredient_amounts\" property that represents the ingredient amounts of the recipe.\n",
    "# Create a \"calories\" property that represents that total calories of the recipe.\n",
    "# Create a \"grams\" property that represents the total grams of the recipe.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Exercise 3.1.4\n",
    "# Give your Recipe class a static method called ounces_to_grams(ounces) that returns the\n",
    "# equivalent weight in grams (there are 28.35 grams in one ounce) of the specified\n",
    "# number of ounces. (In real life, we'd probably just use a class constant to do the\n",
    "# conversion, but for the sake of practicing with static methods,\n",
    "# we'll create a static method instead).\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Exercise 3.1.5\n",
    "# Give your Recipe class an alternate constructor called \"make\"\n",
    "# that takes a name and a **kwds arg of ingredient-name/grams pairs.\n",
    "# The ingredient-name is a capitalized string, e.g., 'Lemon', corresponding to the name\n",
    "# of an Ingredient class. NOTE: In order to convert the name of a class into the class object\n",

    "# Create a __repr__() method that returns a multi-line string representing the recipe. The string\n",
    "# should contain the recipe's name, ingredients, total grams, and total calories. Here's an example:\n",
    "# <lemonade:\n",
    "#     <12 grams of sugar>\n",
    "#     <20 grams of lemon>\n",
    "#     <50 grams of water>\n",

    "# Exercise 3.1.8\n",
    "# Overload the * operator for both Recipe and IngredientAmount, in the following way:\n",
    "# If r is a recipe, then the expressions 5*r or r*5 should return a new Recipe object \n",
    "# whose ingredient amounts are all 5 times the original amounts. \n",
    "# If ingr_amt is an IngredientAmount, then the expressions 5*ingr_amt or ingr_amt*5\n",
    "# should return a new IngredientAmount that represents 5 times the original amount.\n",
    "# Note: the methods you'll be overriding are __mul__ and __rmul__. In cases such\n",
    "# as this, where both left and right operations do the same thing, it is typical to\n",
    "# first define __mul__, and then to just put the statement __rmul__ = __mul__ within the body\n",
