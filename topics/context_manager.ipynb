    "This tutorial introduces contexts. A _context_ is a wrapper tha modifies the behavior of a block of code. This tutorial illustrates how to define a context using the `@contextmanager` decorator and how to invoke one using python's `with` statement. It does not describe the lower-level mechanisms upon which the decorator is based. That documentation is in the python manual, here: [`with` statement context managers](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers)"

    "# The Canonical Example\n",
    "We begin with an example illustrating what a context is. This example is so ubiquitous in the python literature that virtually every explanation of contexts uses it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wish to read and process the contents of a file. We first must _open_ the file, which is essentially asking the operating system for a file descriptor, and, when we are done with the file, we have to _close_ it; otherwise, the operating system thinks we're still using it. We have to write code that closes the file even if an exception is raised that causes a non-local exit from our code. That is typically handled using a template like the one below:"

    "- Establish a `try/except` block\n",
    "- Make sure the file gets closed regardless of any non-local exit by putting the `close()` operation in a `finally` block.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requiring the coder to write these four context lines everywhere they wish to process a file is somewhat tedious, and also somewhat error prone, because the coder has to remember the correct ritual for guaranteeing the closing of `f`. Furthermore, if the correct ritual changes one day, then altering the code to reflect the new style involves hunting for every occurence of this template within the code and changing it manually--even more tedious, and even more error-prone. \n",

It is seemingly as though the above two lines of code are replaced with all five lines of [1], with line [2]:2 sandwiched into the middle of the context as line [1]:3.

When we use the `@contextmanager` decorator to define a context, the \"meat\" of the sandwich is demarcated by a single `yield` statement. Below is a simple example of a context defined in this way. Note the `yield` statement on line 8 that marks the place where python should insert the meat of the sandwich. Because the presence of `yield` always turns a function into a generator, we note in passing that the `@contextmanager` decorator leverages the generator/iterator functionality of python to create the desired context.\n",
