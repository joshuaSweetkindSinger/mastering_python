    "  - If we decide in the future to change how the debugging works, we would have to make changes all over the code base.\n",
    "  - The debugging code is orthogonal to the central purposes of the functions it modifies, obscuring these purposes and making the code harder to understand.\n",

A decorator is usually created because it represents a general-purpose modification that could be used on many different functions, irrespective of the central purpose of the function. Applying the decorator to the function endows the function with the enhancement associated with the decorator, and it does so without cluttering the code of the function or requiring the coder to remember the details required to implement a specific code template.\n",
