    "# Decorators\n",
    "This tutorial introduces decorators. A decorator _wraps_ a given function or class to modify its behavior. The vast majority of use cases are to modify functions, rather than classes, so we will concentrate on that use case in this tutorial. Until we explicitly say otherwise, we assume in the following discussion that our decorators are wrapping functions, not classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a decorator wraps a function, it creates a new function that executes some code (the prologue), then calls the original function, then executes some additional code (the epilogue). Since the call to the original function is sandwiched between the prologue code and the epilogue code, we say that original function has been _wrapped_.\n",

    "# A decorator example--debugging instrumentation\n",

    "The following example will help illustrate the kinds of situations in which we desire something like a decorator. Suppose we want to instrument some of the functions in a particular module by adding debugging logic that tells us when such a function has been entered and tells us when it has been exited. To keep the example simple, suppose our module consists of just these two functions:"

    "  - The code necessary to instrument the functions is the same in all cases. It is \"boiler-plate\" code, or template-code. To implement it for a new function, we have to remember the exact template, or we risk implementing it incorrectly.\n",
    "  - If we decide in the future to change how the debugging works, we would have to make changes all over the code base.\n",
    "  - The debugging code is orthogonal to the central purposes of the functions it modifies, obscuring these purposes and making the code harder to understand.\n",

We'll discuss that later.)\n",

We say in this case that `debug` _decorates_ `make_greeting`. The python interpeter evaluates the function definition on (7), resulting in a function object, and then calls `debug` on this function object, assigning the return value of `debug` to the global `make_greeting`. In order words, `debug` gets fed in the original definition of `make_greeting` and returns a wrapped version of it, which wrapped version is the one actually assigned to the global `make_greeting`."

    "The outermost function, `debug`, is no longer a decorator. Instead it is a decorator _generator_, which means it must return a decorator when called. It does that, by returning the function named `decorator`. This function is a decorator, because it takes a function `f` as an argument and returns the function `wrapper` as its return value. The function `decorator` is really just the same as the function we named `debug` in the previous example. But, by adding one more level of indirection, we can now pass in the `max_call_levels` variable to `debug` and have that imbedded in the closure that results when we return `wrapper`."

The next two examples are not particularly motivated or useful. They merely illustrate the freedom possible with decorators.\n"
